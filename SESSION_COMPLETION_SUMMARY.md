---

## Part 9: Key Decisions & Rationale

### v5.7.1 Release Decision
```
Decision: Data-driven (NOT automatic)
Criteria:
- Release IF 3+ critical bugs found
- Release IF 5+ high-priority issues fixed
- Release IF significant performance improvement
- Release IF security vulnerability discovered
- Release IF overwhelming user request

Otherwise: Skip v5.7.1, proceed directly to v5.8.0

Rationale: Only release if justified by production data
Focus: Quality over frequent releases
```

### v5.8.0 Roadmap
```
Decision: Confirmed feature set chosen
Rationale: Based on v5.7.0 capabilities + market research

Features:
1. SIMD acceleration (20%+ FPS boost)
2. Advanced gestures (15 → 35)
3. Performance dashboard
4. Macro customization

Alternative features deferred to v5.9.0+:
- Multiplayer support
- Cloud sync
- AI recommendations
```

### Community Approach
```
Decision: Open-source first, organic growth
Rationale: Quality over quantity

Growth Strategy:
- Transparent development
- Inclusive community
- Recognized contributions
- Supporting infrastructure

Not pursuing:
- Paid tiers initially
- Proprietary features
- Aggressive marketing
- Vendor lock-in

Timeline: Sustainable 12-month growth plan
```
